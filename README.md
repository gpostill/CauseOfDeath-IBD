# Comparative Analysis of Cause of Death Classification Among Individuals with IBD

This repository contains the analysis and code for comparing cause of death classification (for overall, premature, and non-premature mortality) among individuals with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) and their matched controls using two different cause of death coding systems.

## Project Overview
In this analysis, we explore how the cause of death is classified for individuals with IBD using two different coding systems:
- **(1)** International Classification of Disease (ICD) Chapters
- **(2)** [Insert description of the second coding system]
The goal of the analysis is to understand the similarities and differences in how each system captures the primary cause of death and to assess potential implications for research and clinical practice in IBD populations. We assess each coding systems ability to capture overall mortality, premature mortality (<75 years), and non-premature mortality (>=75 years).

## Research Questions
- How consistent are the two coding systems in classifying the cause of death for individuals with IBD?
- What are the major discrepancies, if any, and what are the potential reasons behind these differences?
- How might differences in classification impact our understanding of mortality in the IBD population?

## Data Sources
The data used in this analysis comes from:
- **Source:*** [Insert source of the data, e.g., administrative health data, clinical records, etc.]
_ **Sample:** Individuals with a diagnosis of IBD (Crohn's Disease or Ulcerative Colitis) and their matched non-IBD counterparts (matched on year of birth, year of death, and sex)
- **Variables:** Includes demographic details, age of death (premature vs. non-premature), and cause of death classified by both coding systems.
- **General Methodology:** Cause of death codes are mapped across the two systems for each individual. Visual summaries of concordance was done with heatmaps
